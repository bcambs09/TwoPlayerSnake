This is a two player snake game. Each player connects to the server and can play each other wirelessly.

To build the game, run `make` in the root of the repository. This will generate `SnakeClient` and `SnakeServer` executables in their respective folders. Run SnakeServer to start the game server. Run the client as:
`./SnakeClient <IP ADDRESS or HOSTNAME> <PORT (7750 by default)>`

The game will begin once two clients have connected.
